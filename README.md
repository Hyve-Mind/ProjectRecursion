## what is recursion you asked?
recursion is the _art_ of a function calling itself over and over again until it hits a base case
### Merge sort
I learnt that the built in javascript method i.e Array.Sort() is determined totally by the browser,for instance safari browser makes use of the merge sort algorithm.
So whenever you use an inbuilt method like the Array.Sort(),under the hood,its one of these algorithms thats in play;
### How does it work?
To understand whats going on,ill be using comments through out my code,hopefully i make enough sense
